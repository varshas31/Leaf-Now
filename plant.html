        <p>&emsp;A garden is a grand teacher. It teaches patience and careful watchfulness; it teaches industry and thrift; above all it teaches entire trust.Whatever we plant in our subconscious mind and nourish with repetition and emotion will one day become a reality.So plant your own gardens and decorate your own soul.</p>
          <h3><b>How many plants do I need in my house?</b></h3>
          <p>&emsp;Scientific research has proven that plants have a favourable impact on their local environment as well as human well-being. We've all heard that plants help filter the air, due to a well-known NASA research from 1989. We also know that plants provide a slew of other advantages that are directly tied to our health.

          Higher productivity, being more relaxed, getting a better night's sleep, and being able to deal with life better are some of the wellbeing benefits. That's because the core brain developed in nature, so when we're in touch with it, we're more relaxed and able to do higher functions like creativity and intuition.

          But after knowing so many benefits, we really don’t know how many plants exactly do we need in our house. Don’t worry there is plenty of research done on this riddle and we are here going to share all that information with you.

          Here are  a few insights about how many plants you need in your house to achieve maximum benefits.<br><br>

          <h3><b>1.The NASA Study Recommends</b></h3>

          &emsp;The NASA scientist who did this study, Bill Wolverton, gave some insight on the number of plants you'd need per room to assist filter indoor air. Although it's impossible to say how many plants are required to filter interior air, Wolverton suggests at least two large plants for every 100 square feet (about 9.3 square metres) of indoor area. The larger and more leafy the plant, the better. This is because the amount of surface area of leaves present affects air purification.<br><br>

          <h3><b>2. The Plant Life Balance Research</b></h3>

          &emsp;Horticultural initiative Plant Life Balance collaborated with scientists at RMIT University in Melbourne to examine past and current research on the benefits of plants and how that information applies to our modern living conditions in order to provide a better understanding of how many plants one needs in their home. New research has found the exact number of plants you should have in your house for optimal health and happiness.

          Plants, of course, have two main benefits: improved air quality and increased well-being. In fact, one plant can clean the air in an ordinary four by five metre space by 25%, while five plants can clean the air by up to 75%.

          In an average four by five metre room, 10 plants was the golden number for maximum cleansing and wellbeing effects. While a single plant has minimal effect on your well-being, a variety of plants of all sizes and varietals can help you feel more relaxed, inspired, and cheerful.<br></p>
        <p>The importance of plants to humans and just about all other life on Earth is staggering.<br>&emsp; Life as we know it would not be possible without plants. Why are plants so important?</br><ul>
            <li>Plants supply food to nearly all terrestrial organisms, including humans. We eat either plants or other organisms that eat plants.
            </li>
            <li>Plants maintain the atmosphere. They produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms. It also maintains the ozone layer that helps protect Earth’s life from damaging UV radiation. Removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere reduces the greenhouse effect and global warming.</li>
            <li>Plants recycle matter in biogeochemical cycles. For example, through transpiration, plants move enormous amounts of water from the soil to the atmosphere. Plants such as peas host bacteria that fix nitrogen. This makes nitrogen available to all plants, which pass it on to consumers.</li>
            <li>Plants provide many products for human use, such as firewood, timber, fibers, medicines, dyes, pesticides, oils, and rubber.</li>
            <li>Plants create habitats for many organisms. A single tree may provide food and shelter to many species of insects, worms, small mammals, birds, and reptiles .</li>
